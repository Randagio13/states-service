## Mission

- I've never found any complete library to get all world countries, states, and cities. I want to develop the best one. Of course, contributors are welcome!!
- I took this [data](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database) as a starting point.
- This package is a part of [countries-states-cities-service](https://github.com/Randagio13/countries-states-cities-service)

## Getting started

To get started with this library, you need to install it and add it to your project.

### Installation

States Service is available as an npm package.

```bash
# npm
npm install @ac-dev/states-service

# yarn
yarn add @ac-dev/states-service
```

### Import

Import single named import as follow:

```typescript
import { States } from '@ac-dev/states-service'
```

## Usage

The code snippet below shows how to put into action `states-service` in some common use cases.

- Get all states.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates()
```

- Get all states by `asc` sort.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({
  sort: {
    mode: 'asc',
  },
})
```

- Get all states by `desc` sort.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({
  sort: {
    mode: 'desc',
  },
})
```

- Get all states by `alphabetical` sort.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({
  sort: {
    mode: 'alphabetical',
    key: 'name',
  },
})
```

- Get all states with localization.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({ locale: 'it' })
```

- Get states by country code.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({ filters: { country_code: 'IT' } })
```

- Get states by an array of country code.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({ filters: { country_code: ['IT', 'US'] } })
```

- Get states by country code and localization _(available only for Italian states for now)_.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({
  filters: { country_code: 'IT' },
  locale: 'it',
})
```

- Get regions by country code _(available only for Italian states for now)_.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({
  filters: {
    country_code: 'IT',
    is_region: true,
  },
})
```

- Get a state by country code and state code.

```typescript
const states = States.getStates({
  filters: {
